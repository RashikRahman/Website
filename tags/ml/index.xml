To develop this project I used fetch_20newsgroups which is sklearnâ€™s open source dataset. Following are the labels in the dataset.
    Data preparation was done thoroughly using TfidfVectorizer. Used MultiNomial Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm to develop this project. Model accuracy is 77% The developed model will show the type of given input text.</description>

These are the column of the dataset representing various aspects of a software. These will decide if a software is legit or malware
   Correlation between the attributes
    Data preparation was not that much needed cause it was already a well proccesed data. Did Hyper parameter tunning using GridSearchCV Among GaussianNB, AdaBoostClassifier, DecisionTreeClassifier, KNeighborsClassifier, SVM, RandomForest LogisticRegression, RandomForest performed best with score of 99.</description>
